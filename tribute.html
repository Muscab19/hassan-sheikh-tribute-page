        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <hr>

        Hassan Sheikh Mohamud served as the <b>President</b> 
        of Somalia from September 16, 2012, to February 8, 2017. 
        Elected on September 10, 2012, his presidency marked the 
        conclusion of an eight-year transitional period in the 
        country, which aimed to establish a more stable 
        government after years of conflict and political instability.

        <h2>History Of the President</h2>
        <hr>
        During his term, Mohamud faced substantial challenges, 
        including security issues, political conflicts, and the 
        persistent threat of the extremist group Al-Shabaab. 
        His administration focused on rebuilding state institutions,
         improving security, and addressing humanitarian concerns. 
         Security operations against Al-Shabaab were conducted 
         with the support of the African Union Mission in Somalia 
         (AMISOM) and international partners.
        <br><br>
        The political landscape saw significant developments 
        under his leadership, including the establishment of 
        a federal system in Somalia and ongoing efforts to 
        revise the provisional constitution. Regional states 
        were formed as part of this federalization process, 
        contributing to the overall restructuring of the 
        country's political framework.
        <br><br>
        In the 2017 presidential election, Hassan Sheikh Mohamud 
        sought re-election but was defeated by Mohamed Abdullahi 
        Mohamed, also known as "Farmajo." Following the end of 
        his presidency, Mohamud remained active in Somali politics,
         participating in political discussions and contributing 
         to efforts aimed at addressing the complex challenges 
         facing the nation. It's important to note that 
         developments may have occurred since my last update in 
         January 2022, and for the latest information, checking 
         more recent sources is recommended.
